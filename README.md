# But the truth

Truth be told, I just didn't want to install some other chrome or firefox extension because I don't always need quick access to tv show randomizers, and I just really wanted to consume an API real quick with Vue.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
